# NX-414-Team-16
Project for the 2025 NX-414 - Brain-like computation and intelligence course

This .zip file contains: 

- test.ipynb: this file is shows the results of our best model
- code.ipynb: the code for all the models we tried to train to predict the neural activity
- Report.pdf: the detail of our investigation methods and our findings
- models/DenseNet201.pth: the weights of our best model. Those are used to produce the results of test.ipynb that evaluates our DenseNet201 model

Important notes: 

We set seeds in our notebook code.ipynb in order to make our code reproductible. Two important notes: 

1. The results are environment dependant. Even with the seeds, running the code on a different envrionment might lead to different results. Specifically, we used the T4 GPU on Google Colab to run everything up to part "Utilize different pretrained models with the task-driven modeling approach". For the part "Utilize different pretrained models with the task-driven modeling approach", we used the Nvidia A100 on Google Colab.

2. For the first part of week 8 ("Optimize your current models by adjusting hyperparameters and implementing different regularizations"), the training sometimes crashed due to non-convergence in gradient descent. The seed allowed us to make sure it does not happen when reruning the notebook. However, merging week 6, week 7 and week 8 might cause the problem to happen again. To solve the issue, loading the librairies and running the code for week 8 directly should solve any related issue.
